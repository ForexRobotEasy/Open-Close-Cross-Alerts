# Open Close Cross Alerts Expert Advisor

This Expert Advisor is designed to generate trading alerts based on Open-Close crossover and Open-Close band fit conditions. It can be used in the MetaTrader 5 platform to automate trading strategies.

## How it works

The Expert Advisor is initialized using the `OnInit()` function. It sets the chart view resolution, Open-Close band parameters, and enters the main loop.

### Initialization

- The chart view resolution is set by multiplying the number of visible bars on the chart by 3.
- The Open-Close band parameters are calculated based on the symbol's point value. The band width is set to 10 times the point value, and the upper and lower bands are calculated as the previous close price plus/minus the band width.

### Main Loop

The main loop iterates through the chart data starting from the most recent bar and moving backwards.

#### Open-Close Crossover

- If the Open price is greater than the Close price at the current bar, a sell trade is placed using the `OrderSend()` function.
- If the Open price is less than the Close price at the current bar, a buy trade is placed using the `OrderSend()` function.

#### Open-Close Band Fit

- If the Close price is above the upper band and the Open price is also above the upper band at the current bar, a sell trade is placed.
- If the Close price is below the lower band and the Open price is also below the lower band at the current bar, a buy trade is placed.

The Expert Advisor also includes a deinitialization function `OnDeinit()` which closes any open orders before the Expert Advisor is removed or reinitialized.
